# Wireshark Network Packet Analysis

Overview

This project demonstrates basic network traffic analysis using Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect network packets in real time.

The project covers:

* Starting Wireshark
* Capturing network packets
* Saving packet captures
* Inspecting individual packets
* Analyzing packet details and bytes
* Using Wireshark statistics
* Analyzing network conversations
* Applying display filters
* Filtering TCP traffic

## Tools Used

* Wireshark
* TCP/IP Networking
* Packet Capture
* Network Traffic Analysis
* PCAP / PCAPNG

### 1. Starting Wireshark

Wireshark can be launched through the Start Menu or by using the Windows Run command.

### Steps

1. Open the Start Menu or press `Windows + R`.
2. Type `Wireshark`.
3. Press Enter.
4. Select the required network interface.

### 2. Packet Capture

After opening Wireshark, a network interface can be selected to begin packet capture.

### Steps

1. Select a network interface from the Wireshark welcome screen.
2. Double-click the interface or select Capture → Start.
3. Allow Wireshark to capture network traffic.
4. Stop the capture after collecting sufficient packets.


The captured packets are displayed in the packet list, where information such as protocols and packet details can be inspected.

### 3. Saving Packet Captures

Captured traffic can be saved for later analysis.

### Steps

1. Select File → Save.
2. Enter a filename.
3. Save the capture.

Recommended capture formats:

* `.pcap`
* `.pcapng`


### 4. Packet Analysis

After capturing or opening a packet capture file, individual packets can be selected from the packet list.

Wireshark provides detailed information through:

* Packet List Pane
* Packet Details Pane
* Byte View Pane

Expanding protocol sections allows individual protocol fields to be inspected.


### 5. Packet Details and Byte View

Selecting a field in the packet details tree highlights the corresponding bytes in the byte view.

This helps understand how protocol information is represented within the captured packet.


### 6. Wireshark Statistics

Wireshark provides statistical tools for analyzing captured network traffic.

Open:

Statistics → Capture File Properties

Statistics can be used to understand properties of the captured file and analyze network activity.


### 7. Conversations Analysis

Wireshark can be used to analyze conversations between network endpoints.

Conversation statistics can help identify communication between hosts and understand network traffic patterns.


### 8. Network Traffic Analysis

Wireshark statistics can be useful for investigating different layers of network communication.

## Ethernet / Layer 2

Can help identify and isolate issues such as broadcast storms.

## TCP/IP / Layer 3 and Layer 4

Can help analyze traffic between systems and identify hosts generating network traffic.

### 9. Wireshark Filters

Wireshark provides two types of filters:

## Capture Filters

Capture filters are applied while packets are being captured and can be configured through the Capture Options dialog.

## Display Filters

Display filters are used after packets have been captured to display only packets matching specific conditions.

Display filters can filter packets based on:

* Protocol
* Field presence
* Field values
* Comparisons between fields

### 10. TCP Display Filter

The `tcp` display filter can be entered in the Wireshark filter toolbar to display TCP packets.

The filter hides unrelated packets and displays only packets associated with TCP traffic.

What I Learned

Through this exercise, I gained practical exposure to:

* Network packet capture
* TCP/IP traffic analysis
* Packet inspection
* Protocol-level troubleshooting
* Wireshark display filters
* Network statistics
* Conversations between network endpoints
* PCAP/PCAPNG capture files
